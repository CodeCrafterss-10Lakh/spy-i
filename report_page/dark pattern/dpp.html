            <p>
                <b><i>"Dark patterns are design patterns that lead users to act in a certain way that is contrary to their interests, exploiting design power unilaterally in the interests of their creator."</i></b>

                The phenomenon of dark patterns has already been described and investigated many times, particularly from the perspective of interface design. However, there is no uniform, generally applicable definition of the term originally coined by Brignull. We initially base dark patterns on a broad definition which includes all core elements of the common descriptions:

            <h3>Design Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                The term "design patterns" originates from architecture and describes a template abstracted from a specific application for the solution of a recurring design problem. Computer sciences picked up this term, for example in the area of interface design. The aim of interface design is an optimized design of user interfaces, e.g. the interactions between humans and machines, which in the age of digitization play a prominent role in almost all areas of life and are developing into a central factor in the digital economy. Designers use them, for example, to make surfaces and operating elements comprehensible for users.

            <h2>Types and examples</h2><br>
            <p>
                Dark patterns can be divided into different categories. More information and examples can be found on the following pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dark patterns appear in many different forms. The following categorization distinguishes five groups according to their mode of action.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the classification is not to be understood conclusively. The borders between the categories and types are also partly fluid.

                Pressure
            </h3>
            <p>
                This group of dark patterns aims to build pressure. Users are repeatedly asked to act, they are confronted with (alleged) social norms or an (alleged) scarcity of goods. They see themselves under pressure to perform or refrain from performing a certain action.
